Polymersoup Documentation
*******************************************

Overview:
=========

Polymersoup is a package for *de novo* sequencing of linear oligomers from
tandem mass spectrometry data.

**Note**: proper use of this package requires a decent working knowledge of
both the chemistry and analytical methods used to obtain results.

It is **not** a magic bullet that can solve all of your complex polymer soup problems!
Please ensure that all results are validated wherever possible, and that
the raw mass spectrometry data input to the package is of good quality.
